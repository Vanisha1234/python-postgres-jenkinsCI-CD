# Python-Postgres-Jenkins CI/CD

This project is a **Python-based web application** (built using **Django**) that has been fully **containerized with Docker** for consistent and portable deployments.  
It uses **Docker Compose** to orchestrate application services and spin up containers seamlessly.

The **CI/CD pipeline** is automated using **Jenkins**, which builds, tests, and deploys the application automatically.  
During deployment, Jenkins securely retrieves **PostgreSQL database credentials** from its **Credentials Manager** and exports them as environment variables to **Docker Compose**.  
These variables are then injected into the running container, enabling the application to connect to the **PostgreSQL database** that I set up & hosted on the same server (host machine).

The following project was setup by me in order to avoid manual deployment process that was being followed from a long time. The setup ensures a completely automated and reproducible deployment workflow that eliminates manual configuration, secures sensitive credentials, and demonstrates practical integration of Github, Docker, Docker Compose, Jenkins, and PostgreSQL in a real-world DevOps pipeline.

# Setting up Project Environment
### 1. Setting Up Jenkins
> Update System Packages
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
> Install Java & verify
```bash
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre -y
java -version
```
> Add Jenkins Repository Key
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
```
> Add Jenkins APT Repository
```bash
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```
> Install Jenkins
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```
> Start and Enable Jenkins Service
```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
> Allow Jenkins Through Firewall
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
sudo ufw status
```  
> Get Initial Admin Password
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
> Access Jenkins in Browser
```bash
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080
```

### 2. Setting Up Docker
> Update System
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
> Install Required Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-HTTPS ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
```
> Add Docker GPG Key
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
> Add Docker Repository
```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
> Install Docker Engine, CLI & Compose Plugin
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
```
> Enable & Start Docker Service
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```
> Allow Your User to Use Docker Without sudo and apply the changes
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```
> Enable Docker to Start on Boot
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
```
> Give Jenkins Docker Permissions
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

### 3. Setting Up PostgreSQL Database
> Update the system
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
> Install PostgreSQL
```bash  
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib -y
```
> Start and enable PostgreSQL service
```bash  
sudo systemctl start postgresql

sudo -i -u postgres
```
> Access PostgreSQL prompt
```bash  
psql
```
> Create a new database
```bash  
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```
> Create a new PostgreSQL user
```bash
CREATE USER myuser WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'mypassword';
```
> Grant privileges to the user on the database
```bash  
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;
```
> Exit PostgreSQL and postgres user
```bash  
\q
exit
```

```bash
psql -h localhost -U myuser -d mydatabase
```
> Also make sure postgresql.conf allows listening on other IPs
```bash  
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf
```
> change #listen_addresses = 'localhost' -> listen_addresses = '*'
>Add an entry to allow connections over the network
```bash  
host    mydatabase    myuser    192.168.1.50/32    md5 (for specific ip)
host    mydatabase    myuser    192.168.1.0/24    md5  (for a subnet)
```

### 4. Integrating Jenkins and Github(Source Code Management Tool)
**Please find the Step-by-Step Guide to integrate Jenkins and Github in the following repository**
[üîó](https://github.com/Vanisha1234/Jenkins-Sonar-Integration_CI-Pipeline)

### 5. Adding Database Credentials to Jenkins to avoid hard-coding
**STEP 1 :** Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Credentials -> global -> add credentials \
**STEP 2 :** Provide the username and password of the database defined in the .env file of the source code. \
**STEP 3 :** Provide a unique id to identify db credentials in the jenkins secret manager and save the creds.
